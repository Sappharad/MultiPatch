Introduction
------------

UIPS is a command-line based utility for creating or applying IPS patches.
IPS is a fairly simple patch file format which stores the differences between
two binary files.


Features
--------

* Can create or apply IPS patches (whee).
* Can create an IPS patch based on multiple sources.  That is, you can create
  a patch which, when applied to any of a number of source images, results
  in the same target image.
* Supports IPS v2 truncation.


Requirements
------------

* Any computing device capable of compiling UIPS.C and running the resulting
  program.


Setup / Usage
-------------

Compile UIPS.C if necessary, or download one of the precompiled executable
versions.

Run UIPS with no parameters to see a simple usage reference.  Here are some
examples of how to use it:

* To create PATCH.IPS which converts SOURCE.FIL into TARGET.FIL:

  uips c PATCH.IPS SOURCE.FIL TARGET.FIL

* To create PATCH.IPS which can convert either SOURCE1.FIL or SOURCE2.FIL
  into TARGET.FIL:

  uips c PATCH.IPS SOURCE1.FIL SOURCE2.FIL TARGET.FIL

* To apply PATCH.IPS to ANOTHER.FIL:

  uips a PATCH.IPS ANOTHER.FIL
